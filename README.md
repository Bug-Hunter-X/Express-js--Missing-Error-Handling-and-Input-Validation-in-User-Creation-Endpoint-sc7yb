# Express.js: Missing Error Handling and Input Validation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of robust error handling and input validation.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a user creation endpoint that is vulnerable to unexpected errors and potential security exploits due to missing validation and error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and input validation.

**Bug:**
The original code lacks checks to ensure `req.body` is defined and contains the necessary data. It also lacks input validation to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.  This leads to application crashes or unexpected behavior when invalid data is received or when database operations fail.

**Solution:**
The solution incorporates thorough input validation and detailed error handling, ensuring the application is more robust and secure.  Error messages sent to the client are kept generic to prevent revealing sensitive information.
